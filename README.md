Git Scenarios: How do I fix that?
=================================

Have you ever wondered how to get out of a bad merge? Have you ever gotten stuck trying to push your changes? Git is a wonderful and empowering tool, but it's not your father's version control system. Bring your Git questions for this no-slides demo of Git command line and GUI tools. We'll harvest your curiosities, add in some common concerns, and run through these scenarios together. Have an open-source project you're stuck on? Bring the GitHub URL, and not only will we discuss it, I'll submit a pull request with the changes we build.


Presentation Notes
------------------

I love this presentation.  It's different every time.  For the first few minutes, I ask you where you've gotten stuck in git, and what you'd like to learn about.  "What did you do that got you so stuck you rage quit and just recloned the repository?"  For the balance of the presentation, I demo these things.  Today a fellow conference presenter said to me, "It's presenting without a net."  Yeah, I think so.  It's such a blast.

From time to time, people ask for my slides.  Since the whole event is unscripted, there are no slides.  I got a unique request today: "Can you just post the command history?"  "Sure."  So here is the rambling history of what we learned today.  Enjoy!
